# Design Challenge: The Table Clip

## Challenge Overview
The objective is to design an object that clips onto a table or workstation in the lab. There are two core parts of this challenge. First, the clip should accurately fit onto the table once printed. Second, the clip should be designed with the needs of a specific user in mind.

The time for each section is deliberately omitted. The time allocation for each phase is for each pair to decide.

## Requirements
The general objective has four requirements:
1. The clip meets the _needs_ of your partner
2. The clip has a _custom practical element_ that is defined by your partner's needs. Examples:
    - Holds a drink, holds a bag, etc.
3. The clip has a _custom decorative element_ that is determined by your partner's request. Examples:
    - The clip has their initials somewhere, has a robot, etc.
4. The clip must _fit_ to the table or workstation once printed.

## Challenge Phases
The challenge is split into several phases that span over two days. Here is the breakdown:

### Day 1
1. **Partner interview**
    - Objective:
        - Build _empathy_ with your partner.
        - Identify their needs. Include practical and decorative.
    - Steps:
        - Form groups of 2
        - Interview partner and write down their responses
2. Sketch an example
    - Objective:
        - Create a sketch of the object that meets the needs of your partner.
        - Receive feedback on the sketch.
    - Steps:
        - Take time to sketch a solution based on insights from the interview.
        - Present your sketch to your partner for feedback.
3. Rapid prototyping
    - Objective:
    - Steps:
4. Design in Tinkercad
    - Objective:
    - Steps:
5. Modify and print
    - Objective:
        - At end of session, should have exported a .stl file for printing.
        - Pair should load _both_ objects onto the printer to save time and practice loading multiple prints onto the bed.
    - Steps:
        - Based on partner feedback, make final modifications to the first version of the object.
        - Export object for printing from Tinkercad.
        - Load objects into the Ultimaker for printing.

### Output
At the end of the session, the objects should be loaded and printing. Ideally, each person will have a printed clip at the start of day 2.

### Day 2
1. Test object with partner.
    - Objective:
        - Test the printed object and receive feedback from partner.
    - Steps:
        - Each pair tests their clip
        - Compare and contrast the printed object with the initial needs and requirements from the user interview.
2. Receive feedback on process
    - Objective:
        - Document the pain points of this design challenge.
    - Steps:
        - Work together in pairs to determine any pain points about this challenge.
        - Brainstorm ways to improve the process
3. Share with the group
4. Explain next steps if needed
